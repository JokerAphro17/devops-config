Here are some configurations I have made during my software engineering career:

1. Database Configuration:
    - Configuring database connection strings and credentials.
    - Setting up database indexes and optimizing query performance.

2. Server Configuration:
    - Configuring server settings such as ports, timeouts, and caching.
    - Setting up load balancers and scaling configurations.

3. Application Configuration:
    - Configuring application settings such as logging levels and error handling.
    - Setting up environment-specific configurations for development, testing, and production.

4. Security Configuration:
    - Configuring authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Setting up SSL/TLS certificates and securing sensitive data.

5. Deployment Configuration:
    - Configuring deployment pipelines and automation tools.
    - Setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.

Please note that these are just examples, and the specific configurations may vary depending on the technologies and frameworks used in your projects.
